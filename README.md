# Together
This is the repository for my game: together

## What is 'Together'?
'Together' came into existence when I joined a game jam that lasted 10 days with the theme 'together', hence the name. I came up with a puzzle-platformer about how books bring people together and wanted to really give the two players different opportunities in gameplay. The players are one cat and one human, who collect pages together, and in the end a book.
